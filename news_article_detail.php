                    The Second Congo War is known as the deadliest conflict worldwide since WWII. It began in the
                    Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in 1998 and ultimately involved 9 African countries and around 25
                    armed groups. Casualties were heavy, but by far the most severe cause of death was the aftermath of
                    it. By 2004,one thousand people were dying daily from easily preventable cases of malnutrition and
                    disease. By 2008, the war, and the immediate impact on society, had caused 5.4 million deaths and
                    made at least 2 million people homeless.

                    The worst of it is, it isn’t over yet. Although a peace agreement was signed in 2002, the war has
                    spilled out into several related conflicts, including the ongoing Lord’s Resistance Army
                    insurgency, and the Kivu and Ituri conflicts. Pockets of heavy fighting continues in many regions
                    of DRC, with the most frequent and severe being in Kivu – the area surrounding Goma, where Calvary
                    Chapel Goma is situated. Ever since the country has been ravaged by war, starting with the First
                    Congo War in 1996, it has never been able to recover. The food, housing, medical and basic needs
                    situations of millions of Congolese are still very desperate and severe.
                    <br><br>
                    Proper schooling, for many Congolese, continues to be more of a luxury, and for some is still not a
                    realistic opportunity.
                    <br><br>
                    As if that wasn’t enough, the situation is only being made worse by several other factors. The first
                    is some of the worst corruption the face of the Earth has ever seen. It is common knowledge that the
                    DRC is the richest country in the world when it comes to resources.
                    <br><br>
                    The country is massive – the size of Western Europe – and has rich reserves of almost every type of
                    mineral, including diamonds, gold, and several rare metals. The DRC has the potential to enjoy
                    astronomical wealth if only resources were protected and properly managed. Instead, the mineral
                    wealth is what has been used to fund the ongoing wars. Armed militias have seized mines and enlisted
                    slave labor. The government is weak, and law and order are simply not present in many parts of the
                    country.
                    <br><br>
                    This has continued to be the case because it is in the interests of those with power and influence
                    to destroy, suppress and prevent any strong, stable government. That would interfere with the easy
                    extraction and trade of the nation’s resources. One could say that Congo’s biggest blessing has also
                    been its biggest curse.

                            The second, is that many militia are continuing to use children as solders. The first person
                            to
                            ever be convicted by the ICC, Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, led a militia that was estimated to be
                            made
                            up of 30% children. In 2011, it was estimated that 30,000 children were still operating with
                            armed groups and the UN referred to child soldier recruitment as ‘endemic.’
                            <br><br>
                            Today, several thousand children are thought to still be operating with armed groups.
                            The third is that thousands of girls and women are being sexually assaulted and raped by
                            several
                            militias on a daily basis. The situation is so severe that the DRC has been dubbed, ‘the
                            rape
                            capital
                            <br><br>
                            of the world.’ The Kivu conflict, in particular, has created sheer chaos and disorder in the
                            areas surrounding Goma. This has enabled widespread sexual assault, with several

            <div>
                <p>
                    incidents
                    involving girls forced into militia forces as sex slaves. The most publicised example of
                    this
                    occurred in 2012, where militia troops conducted systematic rape against women and girls in
                    Minova, DRC, over a period of three days. This resulted in widespread international
                    condemnation, prompting the Minova Trial – the largest rape trial in history.
                    <br><br>
                    The fourth, is the active volcano, Mount Nyiragongo, which straddles Goma town. Eruptions in
                    2002 caused the death of 245 people from carbon dioxide asphyxiation and buildings
                    collapsing
                    due to the lava and earthquakes. Lava covered about 13% of Goma and nearly 120,000 people
                    were
                    left homeless. During the very recent 2021 eruption, 32 people died and at least 1,000 homes
                    were destroyed. Residents were not given the opportunity to evacuate, due to the Goma
                    Volcano
                    Observatory not properly functioning for almost a year prior to the eruption. This occurred
                    as a
                    result of the World Bank cutting its funding to the organisation after strong allegations of
                    corruption. This is very concerning for Goma residents, as eruptions could occur at any time
                    and
                    be even more severe than those in the past.
                    <br><br>
                    The fifth, is that Lake Kivu, whose northern shore touches Goma, is an extremely toxic lake
                    and
                    poses a threat to the millions of people living around it. The lake has been estimated
                    tocontain
                    200 cubic miles of carbon dioxide and 40 cubic miles of methane that have bubbled in from
                    volcanic vents. Due to the lake’s depth, the gases are trapped in layers far below the
                    lake’s
                    surface by the intense water pressure at those depths.- Scientists have warned it has the
                    potential for a major, catastrophic gas (limnic) eruption at any given time, where many
                    cubic
                    miles of gas would be released. This could be triggered by an earthquake, volcanic eruption
                    or
                    landslide. Lake Nyos in Cameroon similarly accumulates and traps large amounts of dissolved
                    gasfrom a volcanic vent at the bottom of the lake. A landslide in 1986caused the rapid
                    release
                    of dissolved CO2 into the air, forming a large, deadly cloud. An estimated 1,800 people in
                    nearby villages were asphyxiated by the gas.

                    It is easy to see the great need for GCM to enter the DRC, especially Goma, where Calvary
                    Chapel
                    Goma is currently being planted. Provision of food, housing, medical care, education and
                    other
                    basic needs are desperately needed. Housing needs to be

                    in a secure environment, providing refuge from the ongoing conflicts and exploitation of children
                    and women. At the same time, and perhaps more importantly, the community of Goma urgently need
                    encouragement and direction. They need to be reminded of the promises in scripture for those who
                    trust in God, e.g. Isaiah 41:10: ‘Fear not, for I am with you;Be not dismayed, for I am your God.I
                    will strengthen you,Yes, I will help you,I will uphold you with My righteous right hand.’
                    Discipleship is absolutely crucial to this. Through GCM, the Body of Christ in Goma will receive
                    upliftment, exhortations and comfort, while at the same time receive edification and instruction in
                    how to respond to the corruption, abuse, violence and other evils occurring all around them.
