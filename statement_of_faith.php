                            same communication. The Communication: We subject ourselves in obedience and submission to
                            the authority of God’s word, Matthew 16:13-20. We believe that fellowship should not be
                            forsaken, Hebrews 10:23-25 and as the church, we should participate in the pillars of the

We also believe all of the gifts of the Holy Spirit mentioned in the Scriptures are valid for today and that they are to be exercised within the scriptural guidelines set forth by the Spirit.

                        We believe God’s plan for human sexuality is to be expressed only within the context of marriage, that God created man and woman as unique biological persons made to complete each other. God instituted monogamous marriage between male and female as the foundation of the family and the basic structure of human society. For this reason, we believe that marriage is exclusively the union of one genetic male and one genetic female. Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:5-6; Mark 10:6-9; Romans 1:26-27; 1 Corinthians 6:9.
