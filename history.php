                We have been in Africa for 11 years. Planting Churches in Kenya has been an amazing and eye opening journey. As we have traveled throughout Kenya and Africa, we’ve seen the need is great and worthy of our help. Poverty has plunged people into the worst conditions; hunger, nakedness, abuse, homelessness and worse of all, there is little knowledge of Jesus Christ the Savior of the world. It is only human to help them physically, It is Christian to help them Spiritually and Share the Gospel. Throughout our history in Africa we have seen a lot of help of the physical with a neglect of the Spiritual. That’s why every child we rescue and give a home will be plugged into the Church. Jesus Christ said the gates of hell will not prevail against the Church. Many Children and underprivileged women need our help. With the different church plants in Africa we have a place to disciple but these kids need food, clothing, education, and even a home. In 2010 Josh and Kelsey Lawrence went to Kenya and planted Calvary Chapel Eldoret, Kenya. Hundreds of lives have been saved and renewed. The Church has grown to be a great pillar and light in the community. Our hearts should break for what breaks Jesus Christ’s. James 1:27 says, “Pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their trouble, and to keep oneself unspotted from the world.” Proverbs 14:31, “Whoever oppresses a poor man insults his Maker, but he who is generous to the needy honors him.” Also we offer more than just physical help. We share the Hope of the Gospel and discipleship which is the Great Commission.
